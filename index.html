Beans have been a part of history since the dawn of time. They've influenced the world leaders on their decisions. Ancient pharohs of egypt have used beans to show their status of power. Throughout the years there has been one question that has stayed on the minds of millions. "Where should beans be and where should they not be?" Wars have been fought over this question but in recent years scientists have narrowed it down to a simple list and examples of it. This is the closest we've gotten to answering this question and we're about to show you this sensitive information.

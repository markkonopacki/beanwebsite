        Beans have such a rich history in the world. They were first discovered by Ronald Bean in 1438. They were originally used as a medicinal tool but ever since that they have been used for nearly anything. The pharohs used beans as a sign of their royalty and peasents used it as a source of entertainment. World War I was a major turning point in the history of beans. The Germans discovered the power of the beans and they tried to use it to conquer the world. They were foiled by the Allied powers as they also harnessed the bean power. The use of beans were banned in the Treaty of Versailles until the ban wasn't lifted until the 1970s. Since then there has been a plethora of uses for them. The world holds it's breathe waiting for new innovative ways to use beans.
